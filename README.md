This is a template for `acmart` publications. The template is suitable
for drafting a paper.

Compile author draft:

    $ make draft

Compile for submission:

    $ make submit

Compile for camera ready release:

    $ make release

The output contains two PDF files: [`paper.pdf`](./paper.pdf) and [`paper-suppl.pdf`](./paper-suppl.pdf). The compilation should work for Linux and macOS that installed LaTeX distribution, such as TexLive and MacTex. It is unclear if the template works for Windows users.
